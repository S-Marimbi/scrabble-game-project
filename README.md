## How to play
Single-player mode: Ability to play against the PC on the terminal

The board has 15 rows, and 15 columns, each numbered from 0 to 14. 
 Each player starts with 7 tiles.
* The first player puts a word (not less than 2 letters) on the board. It must be on the center star and every word after that has to be connected to an already-played word. (left to right, up to down)
* You get points for each word. The longer the word, the more points you get. You also get points for using all your tiles at once (“bingo”). A bingo is worth 50 points.
* If you play on a bonus square, you get more points. (double letter, triple letter, double word, triple word)
•  When you can’t think of any words, you can trade in your tiles for new ones (but you lose your turn).
* You can use a blank tile for any letter. (0 points for blank letters)
* The game ends when all the tiles have been used. If you have tiles left, count up their point values and subtract them from your score.
* The player with the most points wins.
